  Overview of MikoPBX APIs and integration surfaces — REST API v3, AMI/AJAM,
  AGI, and the legacy module REST callback — with guidance on when to use each.
---

# API

MikoPBX exposes four distinct integration surfaces. They are not interchangeable:
each one lives at a different layer of the stack, speaks a different protocol, and
is invoked from a different place. Picking the wrong surface is the single most
common mistake in module development — for example, polling the REST API in a loop
to watch call state when you should be subscribing to AMI events.

This page is a decision guide. Read it first, then follow the link to the child
page for the surface you need.

{% hint style="info" %}
Throughout the developer docs we thread a single fictional module, **ModuleBlackList**
(config class `BlackListConf`, main class `BlackListMain`, model `BlackListNumbers`,
table `m_BlackListNumbers`, frontend `module-black-list.js`), so each pattern has a
concrete home. For every pattern we also point to a **real, working example module**
under `Extensions/EXAMPLES/`.
{% endhint %}

## The four surfaces at a glance

| Surface | Protocol / transport | Lives in | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [REST API v3](rest-api.md) | HTTPS, JSON, attribute-routed | `Core/src/PBXCoreREST/` | Management & CRUD, external integrations, module endpoints |
| [AMI / AJAM](ami-ajam.md) | TCP 5038 (AMI) / HTTP (AJAM) | `Core/src/Core/Asterisk/AsteriskManager.php` | Real-time Asterisk events and live commands in workers |
| [AGI](agi.md) | Dialplan-invoked PHP scripts | `Core/src/Core/Asterisk/AGI.php`, `agi-bin/` | Per-call, in-dialplan decision logic |
| Module REST callback (legacy v1/v2) | HTTPS, JSON, route-table | module `*Conf.php` | Older modules; simple custom endpoints |

## REST API v3 — management and CRUD

The modern, recommended surface for anything that reads or writes configuration,
manages resources, or is consumed by an external system (a CRM, a provisioning
script, a mobile app, another server).

- **Routing** is auto-discovered from PHP 8.4 attributes (`#[ApiResource]`,
  `#[HttpMapping]`, `#[ResourceSecurity]`) by `RouterProvider`. You declare a
  resource class with attributes; no manual route table.
- **Authentication** is JWT Bearer tokens (HMAC-SHA256, 15-min access + 30-day
  refresh) or 64-char API keys, with `Resource:Action` RBAC. Requests from
  `127.0.0.1`/`::1` bypass authentication.
- **URL shape** is conventional REST:

  ```
  GET    /pbxcore/api/v3/{resource}           → getList
  GET    /pbxcore/api/v3/{resource}/{id}      → getRecord
  POST   /pbxcore/api/v3/{resource}           → create
  PUT    /pbxcore/api/v3/{resource}/{id}      → update
  PATCH  /pbxcore/api/v3/{resource}/{id}      → patch
  DELETE /pbxcore/api/v3/{resource}/{id}      → delete
  GET    /pbxcore/api/v3/{resource}:custom    → custom method
  ```

- **Processing is asynchronous**: the php-fpm front end queues the request on Redis
  (`api:requests`) and `WorkerApiCommands` (3 parallel processes) executes the action
  and writes the result back. Every action returns a `PBXApiResult`:

  ```php
  class PBXApiResult {
      public bool $success = false;
      public array $data = [];
      public array $messages = [];   // ['error' => [...], 'warning' => [...]]
      public ?int $httpCode = null;  // 200, 201, 400, 422, 409, 500
      public ?array $pagination = null;
  }
  ```

{% hint style="success" %}
**Choose REST v3 when** you are building a new module endpoint, exposing CRUD on a
model, or integrating with anything outside the PBX. For ModuleBlackList you would
add a v3 resource to manage rows in `m_BlackListNumbers` (add/remove/list blocked
numbers from a CRM).

See the working example in `Extensions/EXAMPLES/REST-API/ModuleExampleRestAPIv3/`
(controllers under `App/Controllers/`, action logic under `Lib/RestAPI/Tasks/`).
The module-authoring walkthrough is on the
[REST API in modules](../module-developement/rest-api-in-modules.md) page.

## AMI / AJAM — real-time Asterisk events and commands

The Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) is a long-lived TCP socket to Asterisk. It is
how you **watch the PBX live** — channel state, dial events, queue membership,
hangups — and how you send **immediate** control commands (originate a call, hang
up a channel, redirect, add/remove a queue member).

- **Transport.** AMI listens on TCP — port `5038` by default, configured via
  `PbxSettings::AMI_PORT` (see `Core/src/Core/Asterisk/Configs/ManagerConf.php`,
  which generates `manager.conf`). The HTTP-flavoured variant **AJAM** is enabled by
  `webenabled = yes` in the same `[general]` block and is served by Asterisk's
  built-in HTTP server (`Core/src/Core/Asterisk/Configs/HttpConf.php`,
  `bindport` = `PbxSettings::AJAM_PORT`, URL prefix `asterisk`).
- **Client.** Core wraps AMI in `MikoPBX\Core\Asterisk\AsteriskManager`. Key methods:

  ```php
  $am = new AsteriskManager();
  $am->connect($server, $username, $secret, $events);

  // Live command/response
  $am->Originate(/* ... */);
  $am->Hangup($channel);
  $am->QueueAdd($queue, $interface, $penalty);
  $peers = $am->getPjSipPeers();   // [['id'=>'201','state'=>'OK', ...]]

  // Event-driven
  $am->addEventHandler('Hangup', $callable);
  $am->waitResponse(true);
  ```

{% hint style="warning" %}
AMI is for code that runs **inside the PBX** — typically a long-running module worker
that holds the connection open and reacts to events. Do **not** poll the REST API in
a loop to discover call state; subscribe to AMI events instead.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Choose AMI/AJAM when** your module needs to react to live call activity. ModuleBlackList
could run a worker that listens for incoming-call events and reacts in real time.

See the working example in `Extensions/EXAMPLES/AMI/ModuleExampleAmi/` — note the
dedicated worker `Lib/WorkerExampleAmiAMI.php` that owns the AMI connection.
{% endhint %}

## AGI — in-call decision logic

The Asterisk Gateway Interface runs a script **from the dialplan, during a call**.
Asterisk hands the script the channel and call variables; the script makes a decision
and tells Asterisk what to do next (continue, set a variable, play a file, hang up).
This is the right place for per-call logic that must execute *inside* the call flow.

- Core's AGI client is `MikoPBX\Core\Asterisk\AGI` (built on `AGIBase`). It exposes
  the standard AGI verbs as PHP methods:

  ```php
  $agi = new AGI();
  $cid = $agi->get_variable('CALLERID(num)', true);
  $agi->set_variable('__BLACKLISTED', '1');
  $agi->verbose("BlackList check for {$cid}", 1);
  $agi->hangup();   // reject the call
  ```

- Real Core AGI scripts live in `Core/src/Core/Asterisk/agi-bin/`
  (`check_redirect.php`, `meetme_dial.php`, `unpark_call.php`, `get_park_info.php`) —
  these are the canonical examples of how a dialplan-invoked script is structured.
  A module ships its own scripts in its `agi-bin/` directory and wires them into the
  dialplan from its config class.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Choose AGI when** you need a decision *within* a call before it is routed.
ModuleBlackList’s natural fit: an AGI script invoked early in the incoming context
that looks up the caller in `m_BlackListNumbers` and hangs up if matched. A module
injects this into the dialplan via a hook like `extensionGenInternal()` on its
`BlackListConf` (see the dialplan-generation hooks in
`Core/src/Core/Asterisk/Configs/AsteriskConfigInterface.php`).
{% endhint %}

## Legacy module REST callback (v1 / v2)

Before REST API v3, modules exposed HTTP endpoints under `/pbxcore/api/...` in one of
two ways, both declared in the module's config class. These still work and you will
encounter them in existing modules, but **new modules should use REST API v3**.

- **v1 — single callback.** The config class implements one method that dispatches on
  the action name:

  ```php
  // Routes: GET|POST /pbxcore/api/modules/{ModuleName}/{actionName}
  public function moduleRestAPICallback(array $request): PBXApiResult
  ```

  See `Extensions/EXAMPLES/REST-API/ModuleExampleRestAPIv1/Lib/ExampleRestAPIv1Conf.php`.

- **v2 — explicit route table + controllers.** The config class returns a route
  definition array mapping URLs to controller actions, supporting public (no-auth)
  routes:

  ```php
  // Route tuple: [ControllerClass, ActionMethod, RequestTemplate, HttpMethod, RootUrl, NoAuth]
  public function getPBXCoreRESTAdditionalRoutes(): array
  ```

  See `Extensions/EXAMPLES/REST-API/ModuleExampleRestAPIv2/Lib/ExampleRestAPIv2Conf.php`
  (routes like `/pbxcore/api/module-example-rest-api-v2/{actionName}`).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Use the legacy callback only** when maintaining an existing v1/v2 module. For
anything new, prefer attribute-routed REST API v3 — it gives you authentication,
RBAC, OpenAPI generation, and the queue backpressure protection for free. The
module-authoring guide covers all three patterns side by side:
[REST API in modules](../module-developement/rest-api-in-modules.md).
{% endhint %}

## ARI — advanced call control (when AMI is not enough)

For programmatic media and call-control beyond what AMI/AGI offer (building channels,
bridges, and stasis applications), Asterisk's REST Interface (ARI) is available. It is
served over the same built-in HTTP server as AJAM — `HttpConf` enables the HTTP server
when **either AJAM or ARI is enabled** — and modules can contribute to its configuration
through the `GENERATE_ARI_CONF` hook on `AsteriskConfigInterface`. ARI is an advanced,
specialised surface; most modules will not need it. Reach for it only when AMI events
plus AGI decisions cannot express the call flow you need.

## Decision summary

{% hint style="info" %}
- **Read/write configuration, CRUD, external integration** → [REST API v3](rest-api.md)
- **React to live call events / send immediate commands from a worker** → [AMI / AJAM](ami-ajam.md)
- **Make a decision inside an active call from the dialplan** → [AGI](agi.md)
- **Advanced channel/bridge/media control** → ARI
- **Maintaining an old module's HTTP endpoint** → legacy v1/v2 callback (see [REST API in modules](../module-developement/rest-api-in-modules.md))
{% endhint %}
