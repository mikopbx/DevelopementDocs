# Workers and background processes

A **worker** is a long-running PHP process that does work outside the HTTP request cycle:
listening for call events from Asterisk, draining a job queue, polling an external API,
periodic housekeeping. MikoPBX ships a worker framework in `MikoPBX\Core\Workers` and a
supervisor (`WorkerSafeScriptsCore`) that starts your workers, restarts them when they die,
and pings them to make sure they are alive.

This page shows how a module declares its workers, the two main runtime patterns (Beanstalk
queue and AMI event stream), and the rules you must follow so the supervisor can keep your
process healthy.

Throughout we use the running example module **ModuleBlackList** (config class `BlackListConf`,
worker `WorkerBlackListAMI`). For complete, working code, read the two example modules pinned
below — every snippet on this page is distilled from them:

* Beanstalk queue worker: `Extensions/EXAMPLES/WebInterface/ModuleExampleForm/Lib/WorkerExampleFormMain.php`
* AMI event worker: `Extensions/EXAMPLES/AMI/ModuleExampleAmi/Lib/WorkerExampleAmiAMI.php`

## The worker contract

Every worker extends `MikoPBX\Core\Workers\WorkerBase`, which is declared as:

{% code title="src/Core/Workers/WorkerBase.php" %}
```php
abstract class WorkerBase extends \Phalcon\Di\Injectable implements WorkerInterface
```
{% endcode %}

Because `WorkerBase` extends `Phalcon\Di\Injectable`, every worker has the dependency-injection
container available through `$this->getDI()` and lazy property access (e.g. `$this->config`),
exactly like a controller or a model.

`WorkerInterface` is the minimal contract. It declares only three methods you have to care
about (plus the constructor):

{% code title="src/Core/Workers/WorkerInterface.php" %}
```php
interface WorkerInterface
{
    public function __construct();

    /** Keep-alive ping handler, called by the supervisor over Beanstalk. */
    public function pingCallBack(BeanstalkClient $message): void;

    /** Path of the PID file that proves this worker is running. */
    public function getPidFile(): string;

    /** Worker entry point — your main loop lives here. */
    public function start(array $argv): void;
}
```
{% endcode %}

`WorkerBase` already implements `pingCallBack()` and `getPidFile()` for you, so in practice the
only method you **must** override is `start()`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The signature is `public function start(array $argv): void`. Note the `array` type hint on
`$argv` and the `void` return type — some shorthand snippets omit the `array` hint, but your
override must match the interface exactly or PHP 8.4 will raise a fatal error. The argument
carries the CLI arguments the supervisor used to launch the process.
{% endhint %}

### The main loop and `needRestart`

`WorkerBase` exposes a protected boolean `$needRestart` (default `false`) and a protected
helper `setWorkerState(int $state)`. The canonical loop runs while a restart has **not** been
requested:

```php
public function start(array $argv): void
{
    $this->setWorkerState(self::STATE_RUNNING);

    while ($this->needRestart === false) {
        pcntl_signal_dispatch();   // let queued signals run if not using async signals
        // ... do one unit of work, then block briefly ...
        sleep(1);
    }
    // falling out of the loop returns normally → clean shutdown
}
```

When the supervisor wants your worker to restart (for example after a graceful reconfigure),
it sends `SIGUSR1`. `WorkerBase` handles that signal for you: the default
`handleSignalUsr1()` simply sets `$this->needRestart = true`, so your loop condition becomes
false and `start()` returns. The supervisor then spawns a fresh process. `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`
trigger an immediate, clean stop (the base class releases the Redis socket and calls `exit(0)`).

The worker-state constants on `WorkerBase` are `STATE_STARTING = 1`, `STATE_RUNNING = 2`,
`STATE_STOPPING = 3`, and `STATE_RESTARTING = 4`. Call `setWorkerState(self::STATE_RUNNING)`
once you have finished initialising and are about to enter the loop — it produces a structured
syslog line and is what the supervisor's logs key off.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Never call `die()` or `exit()` inside your own worker code.** A worker that exits on its own
fights the supervisor: `WorkerSafeScriptsCore` immediately respawns it, and a tight crash loop
follows. To stop or restart, set `$this->needRestart = true` and **return** from `start()` (or
break out of the loop). Let `WorkerBase` own the process lifecycle and the `exit()` calls.
{% endhint %}

## Pattern 1 — Beanstalk queue worker

Use this when other parts of the system (or your own controllers) push messages onto a named
queue and your worker processes them one at a time. Beanstalk is the standard MikoPBX
inter-process job bus.

A Beanstalk worker subscribes to two tubes — its own work tube plus a **ping tube** the
supervisor uses for keep-alive checks — and then blocks in `wait()` forever:

{% code title="Extensions/EXAMPLES/WebInterface/ModuleExampleForm/Lib/WorkerExampleFormMain.php" %}
```php
namespace Modules\ModuleExampleForm\Lib;

use MikoPBX\Common\Handlers\CriticalErrorsHandler;
use MikoPBX\Core\System\BeanstalkClient;
use MikoPBX\Core\Workers\WorkerBase;

require_once 'Globals.php';

class WorkerExampleFormMain extends WorkerBase
{
    protected ExampleFormMain $templateMain;

    public function start(array $argv): void
    {
        $this->templateMain = new ExampleFormMain();

        $client = new BeanstalkClient(self::class);

        // Keep-alive: subscribe to the ping tube and answer with pingCallBack().
        $client->subscribe($this->makePingTubeName(self::class), [$this, 'pingCallBack']);

        // Real work: subscribe to the worker's own tube.
        $client->subscribe(self::class, [$this, 'beanstalkCallback']);

        while (true) {
            $client->wait();
        }
    }

    public function beanstalkCallback(BeanstalkClient $message): void
    {
        $receivedMessage = json_decode($message->getBody(), true);
        $this->templateMain->processBeanstalkMessage($receivedMessage);
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Key APIs, all confirmed against `src/Core/System/BeanstalkClient.php`:

* `new BeanstalkClient(string $tube = 'default')` — opens a connection; passing `self::class`
  names the worker's tube after its own class.
* `subscribe(string $tube, array $callback): void` — registers a `[$object, 'method']` callback
  for a tube. Subscribe to **both** your work tube and `makePingTubeName(self::class)`.
* `wait(float $timeout = 5): void` — blocks for the next reserved job and dispatches it to the
  matching callback. Loop on it.
* Inside a callback, `BeanstalkClient::getBody(): string` returns the raw payload and
  `reply(string $response): void` sends a response back to a requester that used `request()`.

`makePingTubeName(string $workerClassName): string` (on `WorkerBase`) derives the ping tube
name from the class name. The supervisor's `CHECK_BY_BEANSTALK` health check sends a message to
this tube; `WorkerBase::pingCallBack()` answers it with a `:pong` reply. You normally just wire
`pingCallBack` to the ping tube and never touch it again.

{% hint style="info" %}
The supervisor expects Beanstalk workers to answer pings. If you forget the ping-tube
subscription, the health check fails and the supervisor will keep killing and respawning your
worker even though it is otherwise healthy.
{% endhint %}

## Pattern 2 — AMI event worker

Use this when your module reacts to Asterisk telephony events (new channel, dial begin/end,
hangup, peer status, …). The worker holds an Asterisk Manager Interface connection and runs an
event loop.

Connect through `Util::getAstManager()` rather than constructing `AsteriskManager` by hand — the
helper resolves the right DI service and connects to the local Asterisk manager on
`localhost:5038` using the credentials from the PBX settings (the AMI host/port defaults
`localhost`/`5038` are set inside `AsteriskManager`). Then install an event filter, register a handler, and reconnect
whenever the event read returns empty:

{% code title="Extensions/EXAMPLES/AMI/ModuleExampleAmi/Lib/WorkerExampleAmiAMI.php" %}
```php
namespace Modules\ModuleExampleAmi\Lib;

use MikoPBX\Common\Providers\EventBusProvider;
use MikoPBX\Core\Asterisk\AsteriskManager;
use MikoPBX\Core\System\Util;
use MikoPBX\Core\Workers\WorkerBase;
use Phalcon\Di\Di;

require_once 'Globals.php';

class WorkerExampleAmiAMI extends WorkerBase
{
    protected AsteriskManager $am;

    public function start(array $argv): void
    {
        $this->am = Util::getAstManager();
        $this->setFilter();
        $this->am->addEventHandler("*", [$this, "callback"]);

        while (true) {
            $result = $this->am->waitUserEvent(true);
            if ($result === []) {
                // Connection dropped or idle timeout — reconnect and re-arm filters.
                usleep(100000);
                $this->am = Util::getAstManager();
                $this->setFilter();
            }
        }
    }

    private function setFilter(): void
    {
        // Let the supervisor's CHECK_BY_AMI ping through.
        $pingTube = $this->makePingTubeName(self::class);
        $params   = ['Operation' => 'Add', 'Filter' => 'UserEvent: ' . $pingTube];
        $this->am->sendRequestTimeout('Filter', $params);

        // Subscribe to the events this worker cares about.
        foreach (['Newchannel', 'DialBegin', 'DialEnd', 'Hangup'] as $event) {
            $this->am->sendRequestTimeout('Filter', ['Operation' => 'Add', 'Filter' => "Event: $event"]);
        }
    }

    public function callback(array $parameters): void
    {
        // ALWAYS answer the supervisor's ping first, then return.
        if ($this->replyOnPingRequest($parameters)) {
            return;
        }

        $di = Di::getDefault();
        $di->get(EventBusProvider::SERVICE_NAME)->publish('ami-events', [
            'event' => $parameters['Event'] ?? 'Unknown',
            'data'  => $parameters,
        ]);
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Key APIs, confirmed against `src/Core/Asterisk/AsteriskManager.php` and `src/Core/System/Util.php`:

* `Util::getAstManager(string $events = 'on'): AsteriskManager` — returns a connected manager
  from the DI container.
* `addEventHandler(string $event, array|string $callback): bool` — register a callback. `"*"`
  matches every event.
* `waitUserEvent(bool $allow_timeout = false): array` — block for the next event; returns an
  empty array `[]` on timeout/disconnect — your loop treats that as the signal to reconnect.
* `sendRequestTimeout(string $action, array $parameters = []): array` — used here to add AMI
  `Filter` directives. **Without explicit filters AMI only delivers login/ping responses**, so
  you must add a filter for each event class you want.
* `UserEvent(string $name, array $headers): array` — emits a custom UserEvent (used internally
  by the ping reply).

The keep-alive handshake on the AMI side is `WorkerBase::replyOnPingRequest(array $parameters):
bool`. The supervisor's `CHECK_BY_AMI` check sends a `UserEvent` named after the ping tube; your
event callback must call `replyOnPingRequest($parameters)` first and `return` if it handled the
ping. `replyOnPingRequest()` fires back a `…Pong` UserEvent via `$this->am->UserEvent(...)`.

{% endhint %}

## Registering workers with the supervisor

Workers do not start themselves. Your module's config class advertises them through
`getModuleWorkers()`. `WorkerSafeScriptsCore` calls this hook (via the `getModuleWorkers`
hook on every module config class) and merges your workers into the global supervision list.

`getModuleWorkers()` is declared on `MikoPBX\Modules\Config\ConfigClass` as:

{% code title="src/Modules/Config/ConfigClass.php" %}
```php
public function getModuleWorkers(): array
{
    return [];
}
```
{% endcode %}

Override it to return an array of `['type' => …, 'worker' => …]` entries. For our
ModuleBlackList example registering a single AMI worker:

{% code title="Extensions/ModuleBlackList/Lib/BlackListConf.php" %}
```php
namespace Modules\ModuleBlackList\Lib;

use MikoPBX\Core\Workers\Cron\WorkerSafeScriptsCore;
use MikoPBX\Modules\Config\ConfigClass;
use Modules\ModuleBlackList\Lib\WorkerBlackListAMI;

class BlackListConf extends ConfigClass
{
    public function getModuleWorkers(): array
    {
        return [
            [
                'type'   => WorkerSafeScriptsCore::CHECK_BY_AMI,
                'worker' => WorkerBlackListAMI::class,
            ],
        ];
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

See the real, working registrations in
`Extensions/EXAMPLES/WebInterface/ModuleExampleForm/Lib/ExampleFormConf.php` (registers both a
Beanstalk worker and an AMI worker) and
`Extensions/EXAMPLES/AMI/ModuleExampleAmi/Lib/ExampleAmiConf.php`.

### The four check types

The `type` you pick tells `WorkerSafeScriptsCore` how to verify the worker is alive. The
constants are defined in `src/Core/Workers/Cron/WorkerSafeScriptsCore.php`:

| Constant | String value | How the supervisor checks |
|---|---|---|
| `WorkerSafeScriptsCore::CHECK_BY_BEANSTALK` | `checkWorkerBeanstalk` | Sends a ping over the worker's Beanstalk ping tube and waits for the pong. |
| `WorkerSafeScriptsCore::CHECK_BY_AMI` | `checkWorkerAMI` | Sends an AMI `UserEvent` ping and waits for the `…Pong` reply. |
| `WorkerSafeScriptsCore::CHECK_BY_REDIS` | `checkWorkerRedis` | Reads the worker's Redis heartbeat key (used by `WorkerRedisBase` workers). |
| `WorkerSafeScriptsCore::CHECK_BY_PID_NOT_ALERT` | `checkPidNotAlert` | Confirms the PID-file process exists; no ping, no alert noise. |

Match the type to the pattern: a Beanstalk worker uses `CHECK_BY_BEANSTALK`, an AMI worker uses
`CHECK_BY_AMI`, a `WorkerRedisBase` pool worker uses `CHECK_BY_REDIS`, and a plain periodic
PID-based worker uses `CHECK_BY_PID_NOT_ALERT`.

### How supervision works

`WorkerSafeScriptsCore` is a singleton that runs its checks in parallel (PHP Fibers) and:

* Starts every registered worker that is not currently running.
* Restarts a worker that fails its check or whose PID is gone.
* Tracks crash loops. `WorkerBase::startWorker()` records each crash in a Redis counter
  (`module:crashes:{ModuleUniqueID}` for module workers, `core:crashes:{Class}` for core workers,
  both with a 30-minute TTL) via `WorkerBase::recordModuleCrash()` / `recordCoreWorkerCrash()`.
  When the supervisor sees a module's counter exceed `CRASH_LOOP_THRESHOLD = 100` in that window,
  it disables the offending module via `PbxExtensionUtils::forceDisableModule()` rather than
  respawning it forever (core workers are never disabled — the supervisor only suppresses their
  respawns until the TTL expires). This is exactly why the `die()`/`exit()` anti-pattern is
  dangerous — a worker that exits on its own keeps tripping the supervisor's restart path and can
  get your whole module disabled.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Crash counting only happens when the worker is launched through `WorkerBase::startWorker()`. The
inline bootstrap shown below (the form both example modules use) catches startup failures with
`CriticalErrorsHandler::handleExceptionWithSyslog()`, which logs to syslog/Sentry but does **not**
increment the crash counter. So the auto-disable safety net is tied to the `startWorker()` launch
path; if you adopt the inline bootstrap, a crashing worker is logged and respawned but not
auto-disabled. Either way, never `exit()` from your own loop.
{% endhint %}

You never instantiate `WorkerSafeScriptsCore` yourself; you only feed it through
`getModuleWorkers()`.

## The self-exec bootstrap

Each worker file is **both** a class definition and a runnable CLI script: the supervisor
launches it as `php WorkerBlackListAMI.php start`. The bottom of the file is the bootstrap that
turns the file into an executable entry point. Use the exact form from the example modules:

```php
// ... class WorkerBlackListAMI extends WorkerBase { ... } ...

// Start worker process
$workerClassname = WorkerBlackListAMI::class;
if (isset($argv) && count($argv) > 1) {
    cli_set_process_title($workerClassname);
    try {
        $worker = new $workerClassname();
        $worker->start($argv);
    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        \MikoPBX\Common\Handlers\CriticalErrorsHandler::handleExceptionWithSyslog($e);
    }
}
```

Three things matter here:

1. **`require_once 'Globals.php';`** near the top of the file — this bootstraps autoloading and
   the DI container so the worker can resolve services. Both example workers do this.
2. **`cli_set_process_title($workerClassname)`** — names the OS process after the worker class
   so `ps`, `pkill -f WorkerBlackListAMI`, and the supervisor's PID matching all work.
3. **`CriticalErrorsHandler::handleExceptionWithSyslog($e)`** in a `catch (\Throwable)` — any
   fatal during startup is logged to syslog (and Sentry) instead of dying silently.

The `count($argv) > 1` guard ensures the loop only runs when the file is executed with the
`start` argument, not when it is merely autoloaded as a class definition.

{% hint style="info" %}
`WorkerBase::startWorker(array $argv, bool $setProcName = true)` performs the same sequence
(title, construct, `start()`, crash recording) for core workers. Module workers conventionally
inline the bootstrap shown above, matching the example modules. Either form is correct as long
as you never call `exit()` from inside your own loop.
{% endhint %}

## Debugging a worker

Because workers are long-running, hot-patching a `.php` file under your module does **not**
affect an already-running worker — it keeps the old class definitions in memory. After changing
worker code, force a respawn:

```bash
# WorkerSafeScriptsCore starts a fresh process within a few seconds.
pkill -TERM -f WorkerBlackListAMI
```

For interactive step-through debugging, attach to the worker process. See
[Debug a PHP worker](debuging/debug-php-worker.md) for the full setup.
