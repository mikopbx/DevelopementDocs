# Data model

We advise starting development from a proper data structure. Every module has its own database. You should describe the structure of tables on models classes according to the Phalcon models [documentations](https://docs.phalcon.io/4.0/en/db-models). Describe every column with its type using metadata annotations and organize data relationships between other tables.
